<h3>Illikkal Kallu</h3>
<p>
  One of the most sought after destinations in Kottayam is the Illikkal Kallu (Illickal Kallu) is a majestic peak which has a part of its shorn off. This steep rock on the top of the hill, known as the Illickal Kallu, or the boulder at Illickal is easily one of the most prominent sights from any part of Kottayam, Kerala, India. A trek for 3km from Erattupetta along the steep hilly road takes you to Illikkal Kallu and is the best viewpoint destination in the district.</p>

<h3>Elaveezhapoonchira</h3>
<p>This place is named so because there are no trees in this place. It is the only place in Kerala where one can see both the sunrise and sunset from the same place. The horizon enables us to see around five districts from the top of it. During monsoon season, the view of the Malankara dam from here is a treat for the visitors.</p>

<h3>Marmala Waterfalls</h3>
<p>Located at a distance of few kms from Erattupetta in Kottayam inside a private rubber estate, Marmala Waterfalls are popularly known as the ‘enchantress of the jungle’. Plummeting from a height of 200 feet, the unblemished clear waters create an aura of mist around them. The tantalising waterfalls splash into a 12 feet pond and run down to join the river Teekoy. Replete with timber trees on the green-carpeted mountains, the clear cascading waters offer a sight like no other.</p>
